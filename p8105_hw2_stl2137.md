# Homework 2

## Problem 1

### Creating Dataframe for Mr. Trash Wheel Data

``` r
trash_wheel_df <- 
  read_excel("./data_hw_2/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(-c(x15, x16, x17)) %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0) %>% 
      as.numeric(sports_balls)
  )
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...15
    ## * `` -> ...16
    ## * `` -> ...17

### Creating Dataframe for 2018 Precipitation

``` r
precip_2018 <- 
  read_excel("./data_hw_2/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  drop_na(Total) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = 2018
  )
```

### Creating Dataframe for 2017 Precipitation

``` r
precip_2017 <- 
  read_excel("./data_hw_2/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  drop_na(Total) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = 2017
  )
```

### Combining 2017 and 2018 Precipitation Datasets

``` r
precip_17_18 <- 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.name[month]
  )
```

The Mr. Trash Wheel dataset is comprised of data that tracks the trash
collected by Mr. Trash Wheel, with 14 variables and 344 observations.
The month, day, and year is recorded along with how many dumpsters were
filled. The volume and weight of the collected trash is accounted for.
In addition, the type of trash collected is broken down into the
following categories: plastic bottles, polystyrene, ciagarette butts,
glass bottles, grocery bags, chip bags, and sports balls. There is also
a `Homes Powered` variable, as the garbage collected is eventually
incinerated to create electricity for homes. The median number of sports
balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8.

The Mr. Trash Wheel dataset is also comprised by sheets of annual
precipitation data; in this case 2018 and 2017 precipitation data was
looked at. For the 2018 precipitation data, there are 12 observations
for each month of the year and 3 observations, Month, total, and year
respectively. The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33. Similarly for
the 2017 precipitation data, there are 12 observations for each month of
the year and 3 observations, Month, total, and year respectively.

## Problem 2

### Tidying the dates

``` r
pols_month_df <- 
  read_csv("./data_hw_2/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(pull(., month)),
    month = month.name[month]
    )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

### Create president variable

``` r
pols_month_df <- 
  pivot_longer(
    pols_month_df,
    cols = c("prez_gop", "prez_dem"),
    names_to = "president",
    names_prefix = "prez_"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(value = na_if(value, 0)) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  select(-value, -day)
```

### Cleaning snp.csv

``` r
snp_df <- 
  read_csv("./data_hw_2/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  separate(date, c("month", "day", "year")) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(pull(., month)),
    month = month.name[month]
    ) %>% 
  select(year, month, close, -day) %>% 
  arrange(year, (match(month, month.name)))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

### Cleaning Unemployment.csv

``` r
unemploy_df <- read_csv("./data_hw_2/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  rename(year = Year) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.character(year)
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
unemploy_df <-
  pivot_longer(
    unemploy_df,
    cols = Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = match(month, month.abb),
    month = month.name[month],
  ) 
```

### Joining snp\_df with pol\_month\_df and join\_snp\_pols\_df with unemploy\_df

``` r
join_snp_pols_df <- 
  left_join(pols_month_df, snp_df, by = c("year", "month"))

join_unemploy_df <- 
  left_join(join_snp_pols_df, unemploy_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The `pols_month_df` refers to the dataset containing information
regarding to the number of national politicians who are democratic or
republican at a given time. There are 822 observations and 9 variables
such as year, month, president (whether the president was a republican
or democrat), sen\_gop or sen\_dem (how many senators were republican or
democrat), rep\_gop or rep\_dem (how many house representations were
republican or democrat), and gov\_gop or gov\_dem (how many governers
were republican or democrat). This dataset’s year variable ranges from
1947 to 2015.

The `snp_df` refers to the dataset containing information related to the
S\&P market index, which is used as a representative measure of the
stock market. There are 787 obserations and 3 variables such as year,
month, and close (the closing values of the S\&P stock index on the
associated date). This dataset’s year variable ranges from 1950 to 2015.

The `unemploy_df` refers to the dataset containing infomration related
to the percentage of unemployment of the associated year. There are 816
observations and 3 variables such as year, month, and value (percentage
of unemployment). This dataset’s year variable ranges from 1948 to 2015.

## Problem 3

### Cleaning the Popular\_Baby\_Names.csv

``` r
baby_names_df <- 
  read_csv("./data_hw_2/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(year_of_birth) %>% 
  mutate_all(tolower) %>% 
  mutate(
    ethnicity = recode(ethnicity,
      "asian and paci" = "asian and pacific islander",
      "black non hisp" = "black non hispanic",
      "white non hisp" = "white non hispanic")
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Ethnicity = col_character(),
    ##   `Child's First Name` = col_character(),
    ##   Count = col_double(),
    ##   Rank = col_double()
    ## )

### Creating a reader-friendly table showing the rank in popularity of the name “Olivia”

``` r
### Take out childs_first_name

Oliva_tbl <-
  baby_names_df %>% 
  select(year_of_birth, ethnicity, childs_first_name, rank) %>% 
  filter(childs_first_name == "olivia") %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year_of_birth, 
    values_from = rank,
  ) %>%
  kable()

Oliva_tbl
```

| ethnicity                  | childs\_first\_name | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 |
| :------------------------- | :------------------ | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| asian and pacific islander | olivia              | 4    | 3    | 3    | 1    | 1    | 1    |
| black non hispanic         | olivia              | 10   | 8    | 6    | 8    | 4    | 8    |

### Table of the most popular male names over time

``` r
### Pivot wider 
male_names_tbl <-
  baby_names_df %>% 
  filter(gender == "male", rank == "1") %>% 
  select(year_of_birth, ethnicity, childs_first_name) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year_of_birth,
    values_from = childs_first_name
  ) %>% 
  kable()

male_names_tbl
```

| black non hispanic         | jayden  | jayden | ethan  | ethan  | noah   | noah   |
| hispanic                   | jayden  | jayden | jayden | liam   | liam   | liam   |
| white non hispanic         | michael | joseph | david  | joseph | david  | joseph |

### Scatter plot showing number of children with a name against rank in popularity

``` r
white_hisp_male_df <- 
  baby_names_df %>% 
  filter(gender == "male", ethnicity == "white non hispanic", year_of_birth == "2016") %>% 
  mutate(
    rank = as.numeric(rank),
    count = as.numeric(count)
  )
